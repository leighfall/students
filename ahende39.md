My name is Autumn Henderson and I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Cybersecurity. This past summer I interned with UScellular 
and had the opportunity to not only learn python but get to create an automated monthly report that involved utilizing postgresql to pull metrics from their databases.
Ideally I continue to hone my python skills and continue to learn about databases and data as a whole. I will be continuing research efforts with cryptocurrencies
utilizing both python and web scrapers, so this class will be a great complement to my academic goals.
